The Human Textile Reference is a set of short, easy to understand HTML pages you can include in any project that uses Textile.

The standard references (http://redcloth.org/textile http://hobix.com/textile/) suck at being readable to the average layman (though they're perfect for devs!).

Add these pages as a short help link next to your textarea.
